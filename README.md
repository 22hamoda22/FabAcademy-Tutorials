A living collection of tutorials to support Fab Academy

*Created by Fab Academy instructors around the world*  
*Maintained by...*

### Tutorials Guide

* You will find a folder for each week/assignment tutorial.

* Use the template for creating a new tutorial and keep it simple. LESS IS MORE.

* Your tutorial naming must clarify the OS and language used in the tutorial. example: *shopbot_windows_english.md*

* Create a folder containing your tutorial images and use the same naming as in it.

* Recommended images size is 800x600 and 72-150 ppi.

* If you have "side files" embed them in your respective tutorial image folder

* Prioritize the creation of English tutorials (so everybody can use them)

* If it is your first time with MARKDOWN language use this [guide](markdown_guide.md)

> Don't rely on a single tutorial. Check the the multiple tutorials and look for other resources.

Changes will be made to this document thoughout Fab Academy, additions are always welcome but don't duplicate information, just update the tutorials.
