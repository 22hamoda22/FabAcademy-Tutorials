* You will find a folder for each week/assignment tutorial.

* Use the template for creating a new tutorial and keep it simple. LESS IS MORE.

* Your tutorial naming must clarify the OS and language used in the tutorial. example: *shopbot_windows_english.md*

* Create a folder containing your tutorial images and use the same naming as in it.

* Recommended images size is 800x600 and 72-150 ppi.

* If you have "side files" embed them in your respective tutorial image folder

* Prioritize the creation of English tutorials (so everybody can use them)

* If it is your first time with MARKDOWN language use this [guide](markdown_guide.md)

* Don't leave the first line of code empty of gitbook will not index your tutorial.

> Don't rely on a single tutorial. Check the the multiple tutorials and look for other resources.
