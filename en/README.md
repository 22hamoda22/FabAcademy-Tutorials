# FabAcademy - Tutorials
A living collection of tutorials created by Fab Academy instructors/students around the world to support Fab Academy.  Don't rely on a single tutorial. Check the the multiple tutorials and look for other resources.

## How do I contribute?

Additions are always welcome, but if you are creating a modified version of a tutorial, don't duplicate information. Just update the existing tutorials.
Tutorials can be created in any language, but use of English is strongly encouraged for maximum diffusion.

1. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account if you don't have already one.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [FabAcademy-Tutorials repository](https://github.com/Academany/FabAcademy-Tutorials)
3. You will find a folder for each week/assignment. Create your tutorial inside the corresponding assignment folder.
5. Your tutorial name must clarify the OS and language used in the tutorial. Example: `shopbot_windows_english.md`
6. Write your tutorial using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). If it is your first time writing in Markdown follow [this tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/). Your can use any text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
7. We have provided a [template](template.md) for creating new tutorials in case you need a guideline.
* If you need to host images or files, create a folder next to your tutorial using the same name as the tutorial (example `shopbot_windows_english`). Put your images and files inside it. Recommended images size is 800x600 pixels.
8. Keep it simple. Less is more.
9. Once you are done. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to have your tutorial approved by the mighty instructors.
10. Once approved you can read your tutorial in the [tutorials gitbook](http://docs.academany.org/FabAcademy-Tutorials/_book/)
