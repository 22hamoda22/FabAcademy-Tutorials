## 3DScanning with a Scanner: Microsoft Kinect

The Kinect is good for creating scans of large objects, like people.
 It is not good for capturing fine detail and may blur facial features slightly. You need a good graphics card to run ReconstructMe and a Microsoft Kinect.

ReconstructMe

* [ReconstructMe](http://reconstructme.net/) (Windows Only)
* [ReconstructMe](http://reconstructme.net/2012/10/10/reconstructmeqt-1-0-29-released/) QT (Windows Only)

Kinect Scanning Accessories
* [Printable Kinect Handle](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18125) (great for using with ReconstructMe)

### Video Tutorial - ReconstructMe Mesh Cleanup

This video tutorial is a little out of date now (there is a more concise / updated version of how to clean up these scans in Chapter 9 of [Getting Started with MakerBot](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026723.do), but it is Tony Buser's seminal tutorial of how to clean up Reconstruct Me scans. It uses all of the mesh editing software above. It also feaures AS220 Labs member Matt Stultz.
